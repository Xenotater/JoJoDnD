For example, if a Level 5 Warrior gains a Power-Type Stand, they may opt to simply become a Level 5 Power-Type Stand User instead of multiclassing. When you become a Stand User your Max HP reverts to what it was originally, then you re-roll for every Level gained. However, you do not have to give up all of your Levels, and you may have Levels in both a Supernatural and Non-Supernatural Class. Any instances of Trained Combatant instead become a Feat of your choice if you have any Levels in Stand User."
