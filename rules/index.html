                            <p>
                                JoJo’s Bizarre Tabletop is a game based off of the power systems of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure using
                                Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition as a template. The combat systems, dice mechanics, and character building are
                                all taken from D&D 5th edition. There are some key differences however. Races, Classes, and
                                Backgrounds have been replaced with custom
                                <a href="/passions">Passions</a>,
                                <a href="/races">Races</a>, and
                                <a href="/classes">Classes</a>.
                                Each character may have only one
                                Passion, but some may choose to have more than one Class. Each character may only have one Stand, however,
                                and therefore, each character may only have one Stand Type (Hybrid Stands are a thing, and the rules for them are
                                noted on the <a href="/classes">Classes</a> page). 
                                You can still multiclass into non-stand classes though,  
                                for example a Stand User with a Power Type Stand might also choose to use The Ripple.

                            <h2>Key Changes</h2>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Arcana Checks</b> will be used to help you determine unexplained phenomenon. 
                                A successful Arcana check will reveal if an item has been infused with a special energy, or if it is just a trick that can be explained through conventional technology.
                                For example, if one were to see a floating toaster, a successful Arcana check may reveal that it is floating because there are probably magnets inside,
                                or it might clue you that something else is going on.
                                <u>As a Reaction</u>, when you are affected/damaged by an unknown phenomenon that you suspect is an ability,
                                you may make an Arcana Check in order to determine the function of the ability.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Initiative</b> is calculated by adding your <u>Dexterity AND Wisdom</u>
                                instead of just Dex. Stand stats may not be used to calculate initiative.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Talking</b> is a free action. This is based on JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure after all,
                                and it wouldn’t be JoJo’s without a side character commenting on everything happening, as it happens, even if the talking takes more than 6 Seconds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>The Tile System</b> is meter-based. Each 'square' represents 1 meter (3 feet),
                                and all character movement speeds and ability ranges should reflect this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Bonus Proficiencies</b> are granted based off a character's Intelligence modifier.
                                You may pick that number of Skills (minimum of one) and gain Proficiency in them.
                                You may also swap some or all of these Bonus Proficiencies for Human Languages, Instruments, or Tool Proficiencies.
                                These Proficiencies do not count against any Proficiencies gained by any
                                <a href="/feats">Feats</a> or from your <a href="/passions">Passion</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Armor Class</b> (AC) is calculated as either 10 + Dex + Con, 10 + Dex + Wis,
                                or 10 + Wis + Con. You may still use armor from 5e if you wish, but this 'Unarmored Defense' <u>will not stack with it</u>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Medicine Checks</b> may be performed on a character with <u>0 Hit Points</u>.
                                If you succeed the Medicine Check (DC 10), they are not just stabilized, but also return to 1 Hit Point.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Inspiration</b> has no upper limit in terms of how much you can have and can be given to another character over the course of a short or long rest.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Unarmed Strikes</b> deal 1d4 Bludgeoning Damage.
                                You may choose to add either your <u>Strength OR Dexterity</u> to the Attack and Damage Rolls.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Running a Game</h2>
                            <p>
                                Running this game is a lot more challenging than running a standard D&D 5th edition game, but if done right, it can be just as fun.
                                This is because rather than fighting a bunch of Monsters and a boss every once in a while, you have to create a character for every fight.
                                Most likely, you are also using Stands, so for every encounter you have to create at least one character, at least one unique Stand with a unique ability,
                                as well as put the enemy into a situation that allows your players to have a challenging and rewarding fight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a DM, you have to help your characters get used to the game. If they have played any sort of D&D before, this should be old-hat to them.
                                However, if you have Stand Users in your group things start to get complicated once Abilities come into play.
                                Abilities make Stand battles varied, and interesting, and you as DM have to help your players create a Stand Ability from scratch.
                                You can allow your characters abilities to be as powerful as you like, but make sure that each ability has some sort of weakness.
                                A Stand that is stronger underwater, for example, might be weaker outside of it. A Power Type Stand may have great stats and an incredible ability, but greatly limited range.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another thing to be aware of is the importance of Inspiration. They should be given when a particularly good joke is made, when roleplay is exceptional,
                                or when players are creative in the use of their environments or abilities. At most, an exceptional player should get around 3 Points per session.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Character Creation Checklist</h2>
                            <p>When creating a character using this module, you want to make sure that they are built solidly and correctly.
                                <br>Characters should be built roughly in this order:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Roll and assign Stats
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Choose the Character’s <a href="/passions">Passion</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If your character isn't human, add the character’s <a href="/races">Racial Bonuses and Abilities</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Pick the Character’s Bonus Proficiencies, as well as <a href="/feats">Feats</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Find what <a href="/classes">Class(es)</a> your character will be playing, add the <a href="/abilities">Abilities</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Determine your character’s Maximum Hit Points, Armor Class, and Stand Armor Class (If Applicable)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Talk with your DM regarding your <a href="/weapons">Starting Equipment</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If your character is a Stand User, find your Stand's stats and modifiers, as well as your Stand’s Ability, and how
                                    it works
                                </li>
                            </ol>
