                            <h2>Preface</h2>
                            <p>
                                JoJo's Bizarre Tabletop is a tabletop role playing game featuring the power systems of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. 
                                The combat systems, dice mechanics, and character building are all the same as D&D 5th edition, but there are some key differences. 
                                The 5th edition Backgrounds, Races, and Classes have been replaced with custom
                                <a href="/passions">Passions</a>, <a href="/races">Races</a>, and <a href="/classes">Classes</a>, respectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Multiclassing into Non-Stand classes is allowed. For example a Stand User with a Power Type Stand might also choose to use The Ripple.
                                However, each character can only have one Stand. Typically this means each character can only have one Stand Type, but Multi-Type Stands are allowed. 
                                The rules for this are detailed on the <a href="/classes">Classes</a> page.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If something seems to be missing or unexplained, you may find what you're looking for within the 5th edition rules for D&D.
                                Combat and Skill Check mechanics aren't explained here for this reason, and certain 5e features like weapons, items, armor, etc can be brought in at DM descretion.
                            </p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h2>Key Changes</h2>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Humans</b> do not get any special racial features or bonuses. Check the <a href="/races?focus=Human">Races page</a> for more information.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Arcana Checks</b> will be used to help you determine unexplained phenomena. 
                                A successful Arcana Check will reveal if an item has been infused with a special energy, or if it is just a trick that can be explained through conventional technology.
                                For example, if you were to see a floating toaster, a successful Arcana Check could reveal that it is floating because there are probably magnets inside,
                                or it might clue you that something else is going on.
                                <u>As a Reaction</u>, when you are affected/damaged by an unknown phenomenon that you suspect is an ability,
                                you may make an Arcana Check in order to determine the function of the ability.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Initiative</b> is calculated by adding your <u>Dexterity AND Wisdom</u>
                                instead of just Dex. Stand stats can not be used to calculate initiative.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Talking</b> is a free action. This module is based on JoJo's Bizarre Adventure after all,
                                and it wouldn't be JoJo's without a side character commenting on everything happening, as it happens, even if the talking takes more than 6 seconds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>The Tile System</b> is meter-based. Each 'square' represents 1 meter (3 feet).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>The Maximum Level</b> in this module is not necessarily twenty. There are certain characters and enemies that may be more powerful than the normal
                                5e Level cap, but allowing this is up to the DM's discretion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Bonus Proficiencies</b> are granted based on a character's Intelligence Modifier.
                                You may pick that number of Skills (minimum of zero) and gain Proficiency in them.
                                You may also swap some or all of these Bonus Proficiencies for Human Languages, Instruments, or Tool Proficiencies.
                                These Proficiencies do not count against any Proficiencies gained by any
                                <a href="/feats">Feats</a> or from your <a href="/passions">Passion</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Armor Class</b> (AC) is calculated as either 10 + Dex + Con, 10 + Dex + Wis,
                                or 10 + Wis + Con. You may still use armor from 5e if you wish, but this 'Unarmored Defense' <u>will not stack with it</u>.
                                The same calculation applies to <a href="/classes?focus=Stands">Stands</a>, with their respective stats.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Medicine Checks</b> may be performed on a character with <u>0 Hit Points</u>.
                                If you succeed the Medicine Check (DC 10), they are not just stabilized, but also return to 1 Hit Point.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Inspiration</b> has no upper limit in terms of how much you can have and can be given to another character over the course of a Short or Long Rest.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Unarmed Strikes</b> deal 1d4 Bludgeoning Damage.
                                You may choose to add either your <u>Strength OR Dexterity</u> to the Attack Rolls, but only Strength may be added to the Damage Rolls.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Light Weapons</b> may be dual-wielded alongside another Light weapon or an empty hand.
                                For this purpose Unarmed Strikes are considered to have the Light property.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - <b>Speed Duels</b> may be performed when you wish to take an action before your target can react (stealing, disarming, quick draw, etc.).
                                To do so, you must use a single Attack and both creatures must roll an Athletics (Wisdom) Check, or an Athletics (Speed) Check if using a Stand.
                                If the attacker rolls higher, they successfully carry out the desired action. Otherwise, nothing happens.

                            <h3>Tools</h3>
                            <p>These items maybe be aquired and gained Proficiency in through various means. Using them may allow you to make various Skill Checks that you otherwise might not be able to perform.</p>
                            <p>The list of tools and their various use cases is as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Artist's Tools</b> are used to create or analyze various forms of artistry, and may specifically be one of the following: A Filmmaker's Camera, Glassmaker's Tools, Jeweler's Tools, Painter's Supplies, Potter's Tools, Sculptor's Tools, Weaver's Tools, Woodcrafter's Tools, Writer's Tools.</li>

                                <li><b>Diviner's Tools</b> may be used to predict the future, often in ways that don't make sense without context until the moment of truth.</li>
                                <li><b>Engineer's Tools</b> may be used to move something heavy, measure precise amount of distance, or to repair certain structures or machines that have been damaged.</li>

                            <h2>Running a Game</h2>
                            <p>
                                Being a DM for this game is a lot more challenging than a standard D&D 5th edition game, but if done right, it can be just as fun.
                                This is because rather than fighting a bunch of Monsters and a boss every once in a while, you have to create a character for every fight.
                                Therefore, for encounters with enemy Stand Users you will need to create a unique stand for the enemy to have. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have Stand Users in your group things start to get complicated once Abilities come into play.
                                Abilities vary Stand battles and make them interesting, and as DM you may have to help your players create a Stand Ability from scratch.
                                You can allow your characters' abilities to be as powerful as you like, but make sure that each ability has some sort of weakness.
                                A Stand that is stronger underwater, for example, might be weaker outside of it. A Power Type Stand may have great stats and an incredible ability, but greatly limited range.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another thing to be aware of is the importance of Inspiration. They should be given when a particularly good joke is made, when roleplay is exceptional,
                                or when players are creative in the use of their environments or abilities. On average players should receive 1-2 points per session. 
                                It is recommended to not give more than 3 points of Inspiration per session, but this is up to DM discretion.
                            </p>
                        </section>

                            <h2>Character Creation Checklist</h2>
                            <p>When creating a character using this module, you want to make sure that they are built solidly and correctly.
                                <br>If desired, you can use our <a href="/resources/Assets/JoJo_Char_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">custom character sheets</a>, or create one online using our <a href="/resources/editor/" target="_blank">editor</a>.
                                <br>Characters should be built roughly in this order:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Roll and assign Stats
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Choose the character's <a href="/passions">Passion</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If your character isn't Human, add the character's <a href="/races">Racial Bonuses and Abilities</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Pick the character's Bonus Proficiencies, as well as <a href="/feats">Feats</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Find what <a href="/classes">Class(es)</a> your character will be playing and add the <a href="/abilities">Abilities</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Determine your character's Maximum Hit Points, Armor Class, and Stand Armor Class (If Applicable)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Talk with your DM regarding your <a href="/weapons">Starting Equipment</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If your character is a <a href='/classes/?focus=Stands'>Stand User</a>, find your Stand's stats and Modifiers, as well as your Stand's Ability, and how
                                    it works
                                </li>
