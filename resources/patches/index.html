                      <h2>Update 1.12.3</h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          A few important balance changes!
                          <ul>
                            <li>Stands can use their Damage Reduction on damage from some physical Saving Throws now</li>
                            <li>Charmed creatures can have a free Charisma Check made against them each Turn</li>
                            <li>Familiar can't be killed unless their owner dies</li>
                            <li>Melee Barrage was nerfed slightly, no longer able to use Stand stats for the DC</li>
                            <li>Ranged Attack was rebalanced, also unable to use Stand stats for its burst mode's DC and dealing more damage with its focused mode</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A number of small but important clarifications
                          <ul>
                            <li>The 'guide' that we recommend Custom Abilities follow (on the main Stands page) has been reworked quite a bit</li>
                            <li>There are defined rules for protecting someone else with your Stand on the main Stands page now</li>
                            <li>Energy Drain from certain Undead now has defined rules about a person who wasn't fully drained recovering from being drained.</li>
                            <li>Passive abilities are often indiscriminate AOEs</li>
                            <li>Hunker (the weapon attribute) only grants cover in one direction</li>
                            <li>Vampires ascending via the Completed Mask is now a Variant Rule, since there's no canon example of this</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A new Ability was added for Non-Supernatural Classes: Signature Move
                          <ul>
                            <li>This should give them a personally customized move to keep up with the supernatural classes in terms of their 'cool factor'</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Several new Feats: Combination Ability, Equalizer, and Substand Expert
                          <ul>
                            <li>Combination Ability is for Multiclassers and Undead, allowing you to combine your classes' features in a unique skill</li>
                            <li>Equalizer is a way to allow those without a Stand to have a better chance of fighting a Stand User, letting them apply pressure even with mundane weapons</li>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Anyone with a Supernatural Item (Non-Super Variant Rule) gains this, as does Remote and Revenge Type</li>
                              </ul>
                            <li>Substand expert lets you briefly use a Stand even while the other is summoned/active, similar to the use of Epitaph and King Crimson in canon</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Suit Stand was completely reworked
                          <ul>
                            <li>It now functions differently depending on your Stand Type, and Ranged Types ARE allowed to take it once again</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A few small Class changes:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Non-Supernatural Classes get the new Signature Move Ability at Level 3</li>
                            <li>Hive had Swarm Attacks were further clarified, its DC changed and it can't be resisted with Stand stats, Attacking and Defending with half or less of your Instances was clarified</li>
                            <li>Remote and Revenge Types gain the new Equalizer Ability at Level 1</li>
                            <li>Ripple and Spin get their Custom Techniques at Level 3 instead of Level 5</li>
                            <li>Modular Spin gets two features at Levels 5 and 6, to keep up with the non-modular variant</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A number of Abilities were tweaked, changed, or clarified in smaller ways, be sure to look over the following if your character uses them:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Act 0, Artisan Fighting Style, Artisan's Resurgence, Confident Provocation, Heavyweight Fighting Style, Immense Power, Improved Immense Range, Melee Barrage, Natural Armor, Perfected Survivalist, Ranged Attack, Ranger Fighting Style, Ranger's Recovery, Ripple Feature, Special Ability, Stand Energy Recharge,  Supernatural Item, Survivalist, Warrior Fighting Style, Zombification</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A number of Feats were tweaked, changed, or clarified in smaller ways, be sure to look over the following if your character uses them:
                            <ul><li>Additional Sense, Adrenaline Rush, Aura of Awareness, Brutality, Combat Medic, Commentator, Crusher, Elementalist, Extra Experience, Heckler, Feel No Pain, Heavy Sleeper, Object Stand, Perfected Craft, Piercer, Powerful Presence, Practical Experience, Sentient Stand, Slasher, Specialized Save, Suit Stand</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Familiars now have an Extra Sense Feat
                          <ul>
                            <li>This works similarly to Additional Sense, though slightly more limited</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A number of other small fixes and clarifications
                          <ul>
                            <li>Many of these were from the community's issue report channel in our discord, so thank you all and be sure to let us know if we missed anything!</li>
                          </ul>
                      </ul>

                      <h5>Website Update v1.12.2.4</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          New Act-Type page in the Editor
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Act-Type Stands function very differently from others, having essentially 3-4 separate Stands with unique stats and Abilities. Because of this, they never worked very well within the Editor. To correct this, we've now added another page just for them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This new page contains space for all of your Act's stats and info in one place, and only shows up when "Act" is selected as your class.
                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                  This does mean that it won't work for multiclassing. I may consider having the page show up when the "Other/Multiclass" option is selected, but for the time being I don't think that's necessary. We really don't recommend trying to multiclass or multitype with Act-Type anyway.
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              It should be noted that we removed support for Act 0 in the sheet, as they don't really have much stat-wise anyway and cease to exist when you get Act 1. We've also added support for Act 4. Because of this, your existing Act data may be shifted over by 1 after this update, but it will all still be there even if it's in the wrong place on the sheet.
                            </li>
                            This page will be added to the PDF version in its next update, and should be added within roll20 very soon and TTS at some point.
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A few more Editor tweaks
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              The autofill toggle has been moved away from the page toggles to be more prominent, now being alongside the stat-flip toggle.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Fixed a bug relating to searching within the load character menu.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Fancied up the social buttons on the homepage
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              They now look nicer and display our total and active members
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

                      <h5>Website Update v1.12.2.1</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Some small fixes that slipped past us in the recent update
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Extra Experience was reworded to not seem like a nerf, which wasn't the intent.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Special Ability's passive rule has been updated to follow the new ruling for Custom Ability.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              These fixes didn't make it into the newest version of the PDF, but will be there next time we update it.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Fixed an issue with sessions in the editor
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Sessions (your login state) weren't persisting as long as they were meant to. They now last 2 hours, rather than only 24 minutes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Additionally, when you try to save a character with an expired session the logout button changes back to the login button, so you can log back in without losing your changes.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                            A number of rules changes and clarifications
                            <ul>
                              <li>Damage Resistances/Immunities/Vulnerabilities don't stack</li>

                              <li>This was necessary as we've added explicitly defined examples of some specific improvised weapons that have their own attributes and damage values</li>
                              <li>Also used for the sake of Tavern Brawler's Proficiency Bonus... bonus</li>

                          <li>
                            A new weapon attribute: Fist

                              <li>This attribute boosts damage dealt up to your Unarmed Strikes damage if it would've been lower</li>

                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Several new Feats were added
                            <ul>
                              <li>Close-Range Deflection, Feel No Pain, Human Resolve, Phenomenon Stand</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            A number of Feats were tweaked
                            <ul>

                          </li>
                          <li>
                            A number of Abilities were tweaked
                            <ul>
                              <li>Ability Feature, Anchored Stand, Artisan Fighting Style, Artisan's Resurgence, Bullish Brawn, Confident Provocation, Consul Feature, Consul Fighting Style, Custom Ability, Encouragement Dice, Enhanced Custom Ability, Harden Flesh, Heavyweight Feature, Immense Range, Improved Encouragement Dice, Instant Swap, Perfected Encouragement, Ranger Feature, Ranger Fighting Style, Ranger's Recovery, Rejuvenation, Remote Feature, Restraining Spin, Ripple Fighting Style, Ripple Possession, Scholar Feature, Scholar Fighting Style, Slippery, Spin Feature, Warrior Fighting Style, Undead Nature</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Several Classes were tweaked
                            <ul>
                              <li>Ability-Type gets a choice between all the special "Stand" Feats (like Phenomenon, Object, Sentient, etc.)</li>
                              <li>All Non-Supernaturals get Supernatural Item at Level 1 now</li>
                              <li>Ripple and Spin get their 'Spiritual' Ability (that lets them see and damage Stands) at Level 1 now</li>
                              <li>Remote-Type, Consul, Heavyweight, Ranger, and Scholar get a few new options</li>
                              <li>Several aspects of Spin were clarified and some Abilities that were unlocked in later levels have been moved to earlier ones</li>
                              <li>Unarmed Strikes have Open Hand, Light, and Fist attributes</li>
                              <li>A clarification about User stats and direct hits was added to Independent-Type</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            More small typo fixes and clarifications

                      <h5>Website Update v1.12.1.7</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          A few optimizations and tweaks to the editor
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              In the load window, character images are now loaded separately from the other card info, which should greatly improve load times.
                              <ul>
                                <li>While they're loading, you'll just see the default Jotaro-shadow image.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Made the process of creating a new folder a bit more intuitive.
                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                  Previously, you could only create a folder by attempting to move a character into one that doesn't already exist. While this was fine and explained in the move dialog, it wasn't obvious.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Now, you're able to create a new empty folder by clicking the "+" button that was previously only used to create a new blank character. This button now has a small context menu that allows you to choose between creating a new character or folder.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Folders created this way are simply named "New Folder" by default (or New Folder 1, 2, 3, etc), but can be renamed of course.
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Made a few other smaller optimizations and visual tweaks.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>A few other small fixes.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h5>Website Update v1.12.1.6</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Editor Folders!
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              That's right, you can now organize your characters in the editor into distinct folders!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Folders can be nested inside each other, moved, renamed, duplicated, and deleted just like characters.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Moving, duplicating, or deleting a folder logically applies those operations to its contents as well.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This *shouldn't* break any existing functionality, but it's a pretty big structural change so let me know if you encounter any issues.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Slightly rephrased the Account Recovery page within the editor
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Some users have asked for a "username recovery" option. The password recovery feature sends you an email containing your username, but the phrasing didn't previously make that clear.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Created a place for the patch notes (hey that's this!) on the resources page
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Separated the Epic Feats from the other Feats
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              There's now a toggle on the Feats page to view these special Feats.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Added some more old versions of the PDF document to /resources/Assets/PDF
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Added logic to check for an updated version of the website
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This should allow you to get the latest changes right away, rather than having to wait for your cache to expire or hard reload the page
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This may or may not work for this update since your cache might be missing the change that makes this possible, but it should work for every future update
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          A huge first step towards translating our module into more languages has been completed, as Mini has helped us translate the entire character sheet editor into Ukrainian!
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              For those interested, relevant pages will now have a small toggle in the upper-right (bottom-right of the menu on mobile) to change the language, with "uk" now being one of the options. When chosen, the page will reload and all text on the page should be translated to the chosen language.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This shouldn't break any functionality, or break any pages that don't yet have translations available, but it's been a pretty clunky learning process so please let me know if you encounter any problems. As a reminder, you may need to hard reload (ctrl+f5) or open in incognito to see the changes immediately.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              We'll soon be working to translate more of the website into Ukrainian, and more languages will hopefully be on the way as well! I've heard from at least one person working on helping us translate to Russian for sure.

                              These have always existed for the most part, and a good number of them come from 5e, but we figured it'd be useful for us to specify how they may be used in our system.

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Added a note on the landing page about our Patreon
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              There's also a space there to list our supporters, which will appear once there are names to show.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Updated the Character Sheet Editor to support the changes to the second page
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This incldues a new image import, as well as an automatically created Stand Stat chart for Stand Users.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The chart will only appear if any of the Stand related Scores are filled out.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Although this does change the format and content of saved character data, I believe it shouldn't break anything. Existing characters should still load and import properly.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Greatly improved the load time for the list of characters in the Editor
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Made a few backend formatting changes to some of the dynamically displayed data.

                          The 2nd page of the Character Sheet has been reworked
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Before, it was exclusively for information relating to Undead Characters. It's now been both streamlined and generalized to apply to all extra Ability information.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This includes a second image / drawing box for your Ability/Stand etc, space for a Stand Stat graph (which will be generated for you in the online editor), and plenty of space to note down how your Ability works.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                        <li>
                          Ripple and Spin were tweaked slightly
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              They now gain their Custom Technique at Level 5, gaining an "Enhanced" version at Level 11 instead.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Additionally, Ripple Users get Slowed Aging and Ripple Possession far earlier, at Level 3 instead of Levels 15 and 12.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                            <li>
                              They now get Immense Resistance instead of Armored Stand.

                          Some Class Features were tweaked:
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Spin and Ripple now get their 'spiritual' Variant Rule Ability sooner
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Revenge Type gains the option of Rejuvenation at Level 7, rather than Catlike Agility
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <li>
                            Non-Supernatural Classes were Overhauled, being buffed significantly to better keep up with other Classes to some extent
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                The existing Classes were replaced by new ones, the Assassin, Consul, Scholar, and Warrior
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Each one gets their own fighting styles and some unique Class Features, and of particular note are the new Supernatural Items they can obtain as a Variant Rule
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Additionally, multiclassing into both a Non-Supernatural and Supernatural class is now possible
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            A number of Weapons were added/readded, along with some new attributes
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                Items of note include the Atlatl and Dart, more basic 5e-style weapons, and shields
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            All Fandom links have been replaced with links to the proper JoJo Wiki
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            And of course, a number of typo fixes and clarifications
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                Of note, a section was added to the main Stand rules page about their interactions with Skill Checks and Saving Throws
                              </li>
                            </ul>

                      <h2>Update 1.10.1</h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Information about the Human Race was added
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              It was always our intention for Humans in this module to NOT be 5e Humans, since Feats, stat bonuses, and Proficiences come from other sources, but we didn't make that clear enough
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Rock Humans were buffed slightly
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              They now are guaranteed the Natural Armor Ability, which was previously an optional Feat
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              It was also clarified that the temp hp from Natural Armor is granted at the start of each of the Rock Human's turns
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Revenge Types now get Melee Barrage as an optional Ability
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Unstoppable Willpower was tweaked
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This Feat now has a a lower minimum DC of 10, but can only be used an amount of times equal to your PB per Long Rest
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A few more small tweaks, fixes, and clarifications
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <h5>Website Update v1.10.0.2</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Fixed a number of editor layout issues in Safari for iOS users
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Safari has a number of compatability issues compared to other browsers and there might still be issues here and there, but I fixed several major ones.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Fixed a small edge-case logic error with the new act functionality in the editor
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Added a privacy policy to keep us GDPR compliant
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This is just for adsense in the EU. You can check it if you'd like, there's a link at the bottom of the home page, but it's mostly a bunch of legal speak.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Overall, the only personal data we collect about you is your username, password, and email if you have an account in the editor, and your site usage and very general location through Google Analytics. We do nothing with this data other than track analytics, serve ads, and send password recovery emails.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                      <h5>Website Update v1.10.0.1</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Made Act-Types work in the editor
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              When you select the 'act' class, a number will appear next to it representing each of the acts (0-3)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Depending on which is selected, the respective multipliers will be applied to the autofill logic
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              For existing act stands, they'll load up with their old scores in the act 0 layout. You'll have to manually move them to the correct act. The other layouts will he autofilled based on the user stats, you'll want to add the levelup points to these.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This *might* break some peoples stand scores if you had them in the wrong format or wrong boxes. Please let me know if unexpected behavior occurs.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Made a small tweak to the new Melee Barrage rules
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              It now consumes your Reaction as well
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This is to balance out how much we buffed it, allowing the high, multi-hit, DR ignoring damage but making it a risker play and preventing opportunity attacks / reaction abilites
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This Ability has been.. surprisingly difficult to balance. We'd rather not have to rework it again, but feel free to let us know if you have thoughts on the matter.

                        <li>
                          Passions were given a fresh coat of paint
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Most Passions get more Proficiencies now, and some had their ABIs tweaked

                            <li>
                              The Traveler Passion was removed, and a new Passion, Warrior, was added

                              These hadn't been updated since we started putting things together several years ago, and a few tweaks were needed
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The largest changes are new variants of Conductive Clothing, the addition of Imperfect Ajas, and the way Requiem is obtained was changed slightly

                        <li>

                            <li>
                              Overall just made them more consistent, ensuring they get something new every other level

                            <li>
                              In particular, Melee Barrage was finally buffed (we nerfed it far too hard), Ranged Attack (Burst) deals half damage on success, and a number of Ripple Abilities were made less expensive
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Additionally, a new Ability, Nemesis, was added for Revenge-Types

                            <li>
                              These were added to more accurately represent a few unique Stand types seen in canon

                            <li>
                              Hit Dice now alternate per Level, rather than forcing you to take the first/lower Hit Die

                            <li>
                              Specified that Unarmed Strikes do not add Dex to damage, only to-hit

                            <li>
                              Time/Space Abilities no longer always cost double SE, Ability cost may be tweaked at DM discretion for particularly powerful ones

                            <li>
                              The average may be taken when rolling for Stand stat increases on Level-Up (5 + Level for most types, 8 + Level for Revenge)

                      <h2>Update 1.9.1</h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          The Hospitality Worker Passion was updated based on suggestions by Silver Foxy
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Be sure to leave your own suggestions in the #suggestions channel of our Discord, we read them all!
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A limit of 10 has been placed on the maximum number of Attacks per round
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Even 10 is a lot, and would require a speed of 450. Anything more than that would be excessive and take far too long to roll for one turn.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Melee Barrage was simplified
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Now limited to only 5 attacks, the number of which is HALF your Speed Modifier
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              However, you get to add your Power Modifier once, AND the Damage Dice upgrades at level 11
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Partially a buff, partially a nerf. This change is intended to make Melee Barrages easier and take less time.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                        <li>
                          Ranged Attack was buffed
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              The number of Damage Dice are now doubled at Level 11, as well as the range like before
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Assassin was buffed
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This was actually a mistake in the last update, it should've been d8s, rather than d6s
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Whirlwind Attacker was buffed
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              The forced Save option now MUST be a Dex Save, rather than allowing Precision to be used
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Additionally, half damage is taken on success
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Fixed several small typos and errors
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Notably the Hive-Type table had Stand Pickpocketing in two places
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Also Improved Slippery was missing a limit, it can only be used twice per Short Rest
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          The High-Level Stand Overhaul!
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Stand Users now gain additional Class Features for Levels 15-20
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This includes some new Abilities, and some were removed or changed for simplification.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Every Stand Type has been tweaked slightly, be sure to look over your level-up tables!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Some Stand Types have had tweaks to their stat multipliers (Ranged, Revenge, Hive, and Act). If you'd like to update these on an existing character, you'll need to know both the new and old multipliers. For this purpose, the previous version of the document can be found at <a href="https://www.jojodnd.com/resources/Assets/PDFs/JoJo_D&D_v1.8.1.pdf">https://www.jojodnd.com/resources/Assets/PDFs/JoJo_D&D_v1.8.1.pdf</a>

                        <li>
                          Ripple and Spin have been given an additional ASI at Level 17
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This is to match the additional ASI added to Stand Users in this rework
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                        <li>
                          The Assassin and Suit Stand Feats have been tweaked slightly
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Assassin now clarifies that it can be used on attacks and weapons with Ambush, and Advantage isn't required if an Ally is within melee of your target
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Suit Stand now also grants the Anchored Stand Ability

                        <li>
                          A new weapon was added, the Boomerang!
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              It comes with a new weapon attribute which of course allows it to return to you after being thrown
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                        <li>
                          Menacing Aura was nerfed slightly, preventing it from being spammed
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The formatting of level-up tables was tweaked
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              The delimiting comma was replaced by a pipe (|) to prevent confusion between automatic Features and choices

                          Reworded the text on the Community Resources button to be more clear

                          The Graceful Ripple Fighting Style was tweaked
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              In addition to how it already functioned, you can now use Unarmed Dice with Simple Melee Weapons if desired.

                        <li>
                          Hive type Ability Scores are no longer dependant on the number of Instances
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This was a neat idea to make each individual Instance weaker on its own, but in practice it was far to clunky, requiring mental division moment-to-moment during gameplay.

                          A new Feat, Suit Stand, has been added.

                              This Feat is inspired by Stands such as White Album and Oasis. It restricts Range and makes the Stand physically tangible, but in exchange allows the Stand to become stronger in ways not typically possible for that Stand Type.

                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This includes the addition of new weapons, removal of redundant weapons, and the refactoring of all weapon attributes. Check your arsenal for changes!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              A number of weapons that were in the old table weren't included in this overhaul. For the most part this is because they can be found in base 5e, so you can just use those.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Some of the other weapons were too complex or niche for our general list, but DMs are encouraged to homebrew interesting and unique weapons using the examples and attributes we've created.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                              The Non-Supernatural classes have been particularly affected by this. However, Remote, Ability, and Revenge type Stands have also been slightly affected.

                        <li>
                          Immense Impact was added to the Feats page on the site, it was previously missing
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The Editor will now autofill stand scores when increasing/decreasing ability scores based on the multiplier for your stand type
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          One more change was just made to the Deadly Accuracy Feat as well, we didn't realize that our changes to Ranged Attack kinda broke it.

                          You can now import/export character data files in the editor, allowing you to edit the character later without having to start from scratch.
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This solution isn't the slickest, and at some point I'll probably implement some form of account-based server-side saving, but it'll do for now.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This should help those of you who can't print out the PDF version, as you can essentially use the editor like an online character sheet.
