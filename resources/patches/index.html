                              It now re-rolls the entire Check, rather than just providing Advantage

                            <li>
                              Those with Berserker active still fail a Death Save when hit
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Several Feats and Abilities now provide canon examples of their use

                        <li>
                          Touched up the layout of the Weapons page
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              The table is now scrollable, with the header pinned to the top as you scroll. This should make reading the full list easier.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              There's now a list of all the weapon attributes below the table, so you can look for a specific attribute rather than trying to find a weapon with it and hovering over it in the list. The tooltips in the list itself still work as well of course.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                              This means you'll get your next Feat sooner and overall will make it easier to keep track of.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                              Basically a more balanced version of the flight they used to have

                              Act 1's stat restritctions have been swapped, they now CAN increase their Speed, but can't increase Durability

                            <li>
                              Assassins, Consuls, Scholars, and Warriors have had some early Abilities shifted slightly.

                            <li>
                              This allows you to go into a rage under specific conditions, increasing your stats and giving your attacks and defenses some bonuses.

                              These have always existed for the most part, and a good number of them come from 5e, but we figured it'd be useful for us to specify how they may be used in our system.

                              A description of how Light weapons and dual-wielding works has been added to the Rules page.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                          Added a note on the landing page about our Patreon

                          Updated the Character Sheet Editor to support the changes to the second page
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              This incldues a new image import, as well as an automatically created Stand Stat chart for Stand Users.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The chart will only appear if any of the Stand related Scores are filled out.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Although this does change the format and content of saved character data, I believe it shouldn't break anything. Existing characters should still load and import properly.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                        <li>
                          Greatly improved the load time for the list of characters in the Editor

                          The 2nd page of the Character Sheet has been reworked
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Before, it was exclusively for information relating to Undead Characters. It's now been both streamlined and generalized to apply to all extra Ability information.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              This includes a second image / drawing box for your Ability/Stand etc, space for a Stand Stat graph (which will be generated for you in the online editor), and plenty of space to note down how your Ability works.
