Zombies are creatures with great strength and durability, but almost total weakness to UV light. Most Zombies are slaves to their masters, but some Zombies may survive and live after their Master has left them in some way, mostly of their own free will but still slaves to their hunger for living flesh.",
        "playing": "Zombies are powerful undead creatures, but they have several weaknesses and shortcomings, and they are the weakest type of Undead. Once a creature becomes a Zombie, they have reached their full potential, and may no longer grow or develop. A person turned Zombie keeps all of their stats and proficiencies, but they lose the ability to use their <a href='/classes/?focus=Stand'>Stand</a>. A Zombie must obey their master, as they are bound to them. If they have no orders, or no master, Zombies usually seek out flesh to satiate their immense hunger. Zombies are grotesque abominations, taking on some of the parts of Vampires, and immediately gaining immense strength. However, they, in their current state, may not become stronger. Regardless of the experience points gained by a Zombie, they cannot gain levels. A Zombie can become a Vampire or an Ultimate Being, but they need the necessary equipment (<a href='/artifacts/?focus=Stone_Mask'>Stone Mask</a> or <a href='/artifacts/?focus=Completed_Stone_Mask'>Completed Stone Mask</a>, respectively).",

Any experience points gained are destroyed, and your class goes away. You then become a Level 1 Zombie.

However, your Wisdom decreases by 3, your intelligence decreases by 4, and your Charisma score becomes 3 (unless it is lower, in which case, it remains the same). Zombies heal at roughly the same rate that they would heal before they became a Zombie. Any damage dealt by <a href='/classes/?focus=Ripple'>Hamon</a> or UV Radiation leaves a wicked scar, similar to a severe burn on a normal human. Zombies do not need to eat or drink normally, instead needing to eat raw flesh or living creatures, usually humanoids. Zombies need to eat either their entire body weight in human parts, or five times their body weight in animals, per month, in order to continue surviving. A Zombie may be turned into a higher form of Undead (Ghoul or Vampire), and they count as a fresh corpse for the purpose of any effects that would do so.",

However, rather than simply leaving a shriveled corpse, the Vampire replaces some of the taken blood with a small amount of Vampiric Essence (Ghouls may also be created from corpses, even if there are very little remains left of the corpse).  This causes the Ghoul to undergo only minor changes as opposed to its Zombie counterpart. Ghouls are slaves to their Vampiric Masters, but not to the same level that Zombies are. Ghouls retain many skills and abilities that they once had, as well as their sense of pride and moral code. Their psyche is only changed to the point where they still may act independently of their Vampiric Masters, they simply respect and revere their Vampiric Masters. If someone more powerful were to come along, a Ghoul could potentially change their allegiance. Ghouls look very similar to their human counterparts, and are able to pass as Human with little to no trouble at all.",

The only way to kill a hibernating Rock Human is to either break through their rocky shell, or to suffocate them. Every 6 years, during hibernation, they will molt their old bodies and change themselves into a slightly different form. Rock Humans can eat any organic matter without issue, either raw or cooked.
