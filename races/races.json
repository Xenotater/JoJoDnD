Most humanoids are worth 10 energy, and animals give 1\/5th the energy that Humans do (for example, an animal who is the same mass as you would give you 2 energy). EMPs may consume other Undead life as well, gaining all of the energy that Undead had.<br><br>Humans who have had a non-lethal amount of energy drained may recover from it, especially if they receive medical attention. For each energy you drain from a Human, they gain 1 + the amount of energy taken levels of Exhaustion. Each hour, the target may make a Grit Check or a Constitution Saving Throw, with each having a DC of 10 + the amount of energy taken. Penalties from Exhaustion do not apply to this Save\/Check. Succeeding reduces the level of Exhaustion by 1, and succeeding by 10 or more reduces it by 2. Exhaustion may also be removed through normal means, such as spending half their total hit dice on a Short Rest or taking a Long Rest. Getting a blood transfusion grants an additional bonus equal to their Proficiency Bonus when making the Save\/Check. Getting additional nutrients (such as a heartier diet) would grant a bonus half PB. <a href='\/classes?focus=Ripple'>Ripple<\/a> Users and <a href='\/classes?focus=Spin'>Spin<\/a> Users can instead make the Save\/Check every minute, or allow allies to do so as long as they use <a href='\/abilities?focus=Healing_Hands'>Healing Hands<\/a>\/<a href='\/abilities?focus=Medicinal_Spin'>Medicinal Spin<\/a> on themselves or the target.<br><br>Leveling up requires a certain total amount of energy, which is not consumed upon Level-Up. You may not lose Levels in EPM, even if your energy dips below the prerequisite after you Level-Up. Levels of EPM <b>do not classify as Multiclassing<\/b>. You can Level-Up as an Undead independent of your Class, as long as you meet the energy requirements to do so.<br>Your Creature Type is Undead, and your Size Category is the same as you had in life or one Category larger.",

While hibernating, a layer of stone covers their flesh and all processes except for breathing and some brain function cease. While in hibernation, they can survive high temperatures up to 950 C and low temperatures bottoming at around -240 C. The only way to kill a hibernating Rock Human is to either break through their rocky shell, or to suffocate them. Rock Humans can eat any organic matter without issue, either raw or cooked. However, if the organic matter has little nutritional value, more of it must be consumed. For some unknown reason, all Rock Humans are deathly allergic to mangos.
