For starters, Rock Humans usually live for around 240 years, and are silicone, rather than carbon based. Rock Humans must hibernate relatively often in periods of 1-3 months, but after hibernating they don't need to sleep for two months. While hibernating, a layer of stone covers their flesh and all processes except for breathing and some brain function cease. While in hibernation, they can survive high temperatures up to 950 C and low temperatures bottoming at around -240 C. The only way to kill a hibernating Rock Human is to either break through their rocky shell, or to suffocate them. Rock Humans can eat any organic matter without issue, either raw or cooked. However, if the organic matter has little nutritional value, more of it must be consumed. For some unknown reason, all Rock Humans are deathly allergic to mangos. Rocks Humans are more solitary compared to humans, tending to live on the outside of Human towns or countries, or simply preferring to live in the wild.",
