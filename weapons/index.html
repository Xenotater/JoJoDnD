                        <p>You may still use a weapon you aren't Proficient in the use of, but you may not add your Proficiency Bonus to your Attack Rolls.</p>

                        <p>Normal weapons <b>cannot</b> damage Stands. However, if you take the <a href="/feats/?focus=Energy_Imbuement">Energy Imbuement</a> 
                            Feat, when a weapon is imbued (or incorporated into the Stand itself) it deals Stand damage instead and may now damage Stands</p>
                        <p>If your Stand wields a weapon or has a weapon incorporated into it, it may attack using its own stats rather than that of the User. 
                            For example, Strength becomes Power, Dexterity becomes Precision, and Constitution becomes Durability. </p>
